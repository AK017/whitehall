          ##White House tours
           
          At this time, we are unable to process any White House tour applications for the general public. 
           
          We understand that the White House website asks foreign citizens interested in a tour to contact their embassy. However, the US Department of State requires that foreigners be accompanied by a very senior diplomat. Unfortunately, due to the time and resource required, White House tours cannot be made available to the British public.  
           
          You may wish to consider tours of the [US Capitol Building,](http://www.visitthecapitol.gov/) where visitors are able to make tour reservations up to three months in advance or obtain same-day tour passes. Passports or other forms of ID are not required for entry into the U.S. Capitol. You can also book a [Pentagon Tour](https://pentagontours.osd.mil/Tours/). Non-US Nationals will need to submit the British Embassy's address instead of their home address. Further assistance regarding the online booking process should be directed to the Pentagon Tour Office +1 703 697 1776. 
           
          [You can also take a virtual tour of the White House.](https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/u/0/partner/the-white-house#!collection:museumview&8129907598665562501=the-white-house&projectId=art-project)
