# Creating new users in Production

New users will need a sign-on-o-tron account before they can access
whitehall in production.  You can create new sign-on-o-tron accounts
with the capistrano task in alphagov-deployment/sign-on-o-tron.  This
will email the new user and prompt them to create their account.
